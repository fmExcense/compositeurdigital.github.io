## Slideshows

Slideshows are useful to concatenate various files such as images, pdfs or powerpoints to a single document.

### Action within Compositeur Digital UX

* [X] Annotations
* [X] Navigation to next page or previous page using `<` or `>` buttons.
* [X] Open a linked document by tapping on interactive area on the slide.
* [X] Go-to a specific slide using the `Slides` action.
* [X] Make a copy of your slideshow (including all annotations, and pasted documents) using the `Duplicate` action.
* [X] Make a capture (i.e. create an image of a slide that you can edit in your workspace) using the `Capture` action.
* [X] Save a local copy using the `Save as` action.
* [X] Share the slideshow, as a pdf document containing a picture of each slides, with its annotations and pasted document, using the `Share` action.
* [X] Add the slideshow to your favorite, using the `Add to favorites` action.

### Content extension 

To use a slideshow, put all the files you want in a folder, and add the extension `.slideshow` at the end of the name of your folder.
Only use files that ends with `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.ppt` or `.pptx`.

### Create a slideshow

1. In your universe folder, create a folder named `<Name of your slideshow>.slideshow` (e.g. `Mon slideshow.slideshow`).
2. Drag and drop all the pdfs, powerpoints and images you need.


To make sure slides in your slideshow are ordered, you can number them from 0 to X. Numbers won't be displayed in Compositeur Digital UX (e.g. `0 - First level` will be `First level`).

**Important** : If your slideshow includes a powerpoint, and if this powerpoint has "Hot Spots", make sure the content linked from the powerpoint of your slideshow belongs to your slideshow directoty. Keep in mind that content can be put in a hidden folder, which will not appear in Compositeur Digital UX.
