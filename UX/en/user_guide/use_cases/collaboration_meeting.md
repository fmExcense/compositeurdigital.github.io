## Collaborative Meeting

Compositeur Digital UX can be used for collaborative meeting purposes. Thanks to the features offered by Compositeur Digital UX, you can start from an empty workspace and work on blank documents, including templates such as speed boat or creativity templates. 

Compositeur Digital UX supports you during your:
* Ideation processes.
* Brainstormings.
* Design thinking meeting.
* Daily scrum meetings
...

You can also collect all the document you need during your meeting to create a universe, and use this universe to navigate between your project's documents. Notes and annotations are here to help you reflect on your meetings' and projects' goals.
